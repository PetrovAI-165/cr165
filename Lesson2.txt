Interface looks like class but it is not a class.
An interface can have methods and variables just like the class but the methods declared in interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body). 
Also, the variables declared in an interface are public, static & final by default.
We will discuss these points in detail, later in this post.
As mentioned above they are used for abstraction.
Since methods in interfaces do not have body, they have to be implemented by the class before you can access them.
The class that implements interface must implement all the methods of that interface.
Also, java programming language does not support multiple inheritance, using interfaces we can achieve this as a class can implement more than one interfaces, however it cannot extend more than one classes.
